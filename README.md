## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

During the course of this project, i understand more on the use of component and state management. Also, i waa able to grasp how styles affect the
general layout of the pages,and the individual component.
There are of course little victories i was able to have, but the major ones are already listed.


### Continued development

For continued development of this project, id like to try the use of the context api with hooks to properly pass around states and funnctions
